# Use cases


Broadly, the reuisite setup for excret and build here is identical to [the developer guide](/docs/developer/developer_guide.md).  We will repeat some things for easy of copy paste, but not all, refere developer guide in all cases for full clarity on build and auth.

```bash
go build -o build/omnicli ./cmd/omnicli

source cicd/vol/vendor-secrets/secrets.sh # populate according to dev guide

```

## Bucket check cross cloud

```bash

_now="$(date +%s)" && ./build/omnicli run omni.storage.buckets.list \
  '{"params":{"region":"'"${_AWS_REGION}"'","google_project":"'"${_GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID}"'"}}' \
  --out "./cicd/out/dto-omni-${_now}.jsonl" --log "./cicd/out/dto-omni-${_now}.log"

```

## Access Reviews

Access reviews — SOC 2 CC6.2/6.3, ISO A.5.18. The quarterly IAM spreadsheet everyone hates. Biggest saving.

```bash
# TBA
```
